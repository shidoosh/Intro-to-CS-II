# C++ Templates, Linked Lists, Vectors, O(N)
This assignment introduces templates, linked lists, vectors, and time complexity. 
*	Set.h defines a Set class, and uses a template ItemType to enable a set to have different types. It implements the set class with this new ItemType and using a linked list instead of an array as before. 
*	Bad.cpp introduces how to iterate through and evaluate a vector type. The program checks the vector list for movies with poor ratings and removes them. 
*	List.cpp defines a Domain class with a vector private member that contains subdomains. The objective was to implement the listAll function, reviewing how to iterate through a vector and its vectors and its vectorsâ€™ vectors, and so on. 
*	Odds.cpp defines a removeOdds function which iterates through a vector and removes the odd values. This introduces the erase function specific to the vector iterator type. 
*	Sorts.cpp times the amount of time it takes to sort a class object called Stores.
