# C++ Class Inheritance, Recursion, and Trees
This assignment introduces inheritance, recursion, trees. 
*	Animal.cpp introduces the concept of inheritance, with defining the Animal class and the Cat, Duck, and Pig classes as its derived classes. 
*	Linear.cpp introduces recursion in C++ by implementing recursive functions that operate on array. 
*	Maze.cpp continues reviewing recursion by implementing the maze problem from the previous assignment using a recursion on a 2D array instead of a stack or queue. 
*	Tree.cpp introduces the tree structure represented as an array.
