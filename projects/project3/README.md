# Battleship Board Game in C++ 
This project combines everything learned from the course to create our first 1000+ line project.\

The objective is to create the Battleship board game. To do so, I implemented the Board class, Player class, and Game class and the associated functions.\

Players can place their ships and select coordinates to fire. The player can select the difficulty of the CPU opponent, where the CPU has different algorithms to simulate trivial to strategic playstyles.\

The program can also simulate two CPUs playing against each other for a set number of games and difficulties.
