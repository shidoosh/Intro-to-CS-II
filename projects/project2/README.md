# C++ Templates and Linked Lists 
The project reviews implementing a class and using linked lists with a template ItemType data type to represent the structure. The objective was to implement the Set class using the new linked list structure with respect to the following functions: 

*	Empty: Return true if the set is empty, otherwise false.
*	Size: Return the number of items in the set.
*	Insert: Insert value into the set if it is not already present.  Return true if the value was inserted.  Leave the set unchanged and return false if the value was not inserted (perhaps because itis already in the set or because the set has a fixed capacity and is full).
*	Erase: Remove the value from the set if present.  Return true if the value was removed; otherwise, leave the set unchanged and return false.
*	Contains: Return true if the value is in the set, otherwise false.
*	Get: If 0 <= i < size(), copy into value the item in the set that is greater than exactly i items in the set and return true.  Otherwise, leave value unchanged and return false.
* Swap: Exchange the contents of this set with the other one.
