# C++ Object-Oriented Programming 
This project reviews the basics of object-oriented programming in C++.\
The objective was to implement a game where the player must drop poison pellets on a board where rats spawn.\
To do so, there is an Arena, Game, History, Player, and Rat class to represent the objects in the game and perform their associated functions.\
The rats move to empty cells, and the play must evade the rats while strategically placing poison pellets such that when the rats move to that cell, it dies.\
If the player moves to a cell where a rat is, the player dies. Both the player and the rats can only move up, down, left, and right by one space from their current position.
